# Origin Destination Human Mobility Flow Data Analysis

Analyze mobile phone data from SafeGraph, a company that collects and analyzes GPS trajectory data from a representative sample (about 10% of the total population in US) of mobile devices in the U.S., including cell phones and other wearable GPS devices. We will focus on Harris County in Texas as the study area. Specifically, for each census block group (CBG), a time series of daily origin-destination flow (from one CBG to another CBG) matrix can be derived from the GPS trajectory data, where the home location for each individual is determined by the primary night time location using a rolling 6-week window. Specific research questions may involve:  
(1) Visualization of OD data.  
(2) community detection based on origin-destination flow patterns.   
(3) changes in OD patterns before and after COVID-19.  
(4) spatial temporal patterns of OD flow data.
