# Origin Destination Human Mobility Flow Data Analysis

Analyze mobile phone data from SafeGraph, a company that collects and analyzes GPS trajectory data from a representative sample (about 10% of the total population in US) of mobile devices in the U.S., including cell phones and other wearable GPS devices. We will focus on Harris County in Texas as the study area. Specifically, for each census block group (CBG).
The study explored origin and destination data in the Greater Houston area to find differences in travel patterns between weekdays and weekends. To measure differences, the study identified origin and destination nodes that have a strong interaction using ratio analysis. Using the origin and destination nodes identified in the ratio analysis, the study used Stochastic Block Models (SBM) to reveal the location, total clusters, and total nodes in each cluster.
